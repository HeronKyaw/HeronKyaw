## About Me 👤

👋🏻 Hey, I'm Wunna Kyaw, a software engineer at GlobalWave Technology in Yangon, Myanmar 🇲🇲. I specialize in mobile development 📱 with a focus on Flutter (Dart), and I'm passionate about exploring new technologies. While I have limited experience in Android (Java, Kotlin) and iOS (Swift) development 🙁, I'm dedicated to expanding my skills in those areas 💯. I also enjoy building web applications an apis with Laravel and Next.js. For design and ideation, I rely on Figma to create flow charts and visualize my ideas 💡. In addition, I have some experience with Docker, and I'm proficient in using Linux and MacOS as my daily driver. Besides, I have hands-on experience in languages like C#, Java, and SQL, along with expertise in frameworks like .NET. I'm an adaptable and enthusiastic programmer, always eager to learn and integrate new technologies into my work.
